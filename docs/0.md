# **Welcome to R language**

## **Variable assignment is of two types:**

```r
x = 876 * 2 * 2 # * Using '='
y <- 100        # * Using '<-' is prefered
```

Historically, before the introduction of `==` for equality testing, `=` was used for that purpose.
Therefore, `<-` became the standard for assignment.

## **Printing the variables**

- To print out the values associated just type out the variable name
- `print` function is also present

  ```r
  x # Simply prints the output to console
  y # Simply prints the output to console
  print('Hello, the sum of x and y is:')
  print(x + y)
  ```
  **Output:**
  ```txt
  [1] 3504
  [1] 100
  [1] "Hello, the sum of x and y is:"
  [1] 3604
  ```

- `cat` could be use to print custom text

  ```r
  # The '\n' adds a new line
  cat("This is another custom message.\nHey!")
  print("Hello")
  ```
  **Output:**
  ```txt
  This is another custom message.
  Hey![1] "Hello"
  ```

### **Printing custom message using `paste` with `print`:**
  ```r
  my_word <- "example"
  print(paste("Here is an", my_word, "word."))
  cat("The word is:", my_word, "\n")
  ```
  ```txt
  [1] "Here is an example word."
  The word is: example 
  ```

## **Creating a vector**

**Vector** is created using **`c`** function

### **Creating a numeric vector**

```r
numbers <- c(1, 5, 8, 12)
numbers
```

### **Creating a character vector**

```r
fruits <- c("apple", "banana", "orange")
fruits
```

### **Creating a logical vector**

```r
status <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
status
```

### **Combining Existing Vectors**

```r
vector1 <- c(10, 20)
vector2 <- c(30, 40)
combined_vector <- c(vector1, vector2)
combined_vector
```

### **Output:**

```r
[1]  1  5  8 12
[1] "apple"  "banana" "orange"
[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
[1] 10 20 30 40
```

## **Coercion to a Common Type:**

Vectors converts to highest data types:

1. **logicals** become **numerics**
2. **numerics** become **characters** etc...

```r
mixed_vector <- c(1, TRUE, "hello")
mixed_vector
```
```txt
[1] "1"   "TRUE"  "hello"  <- All become characters
```

## **Removing a variable or a group of variable**

There are mainly three ways to remove variables

### **1. Removing specific objects**

```r
rm(x)
rm(y)
x # Invalid operation after freeing
y # Invalid
```

### **2. Removing multiple objects**

```r
rm(x, y)
x # ! Invalid operation
y # ! Invalid
```

Or using a vector the `list` keyword is a simple data structure to convert it into a list

```r
objects_to_remove <- c("numbers", "fruits",
"status", "my_word", "vector1", "vector2",
"combined_vector", "mixed_vector")
rm(list = objects_to_remove)
```

### **3. Remove all objects from the workspace**

```r
rm(list = ls()) # * Closing all memory before finishing
```
